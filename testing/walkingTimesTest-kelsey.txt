Components of feature:

	- Nav.js
	- Times.js

WalkingTimes Testing:

	- Nav.js
		- Navigation bar should be on very left, with a map with markers and moving stars on the right.
		- The Navigation bar should contain a few components:
				live loop logo
				metro times option
				times option
				login option
		- After clicking on times, a sliding window should appear from the left
		- Clicking outside of this sliding window should get us back on the home page

	- Times.js
		- On the window there should be:
			- Two identical lists of bus stops
			- Selector bubbles that change color when bus stop selected
			- At the bottom, there should be text that changes when different bus stops are 
			  selected. This text says "ESTIMATED WALKING TIME FROM source TO destination
			  IS APPROXIMATELY: some number of minutes"
			- Choosing any pair of source and destination bus stops should result in varying
			  results of walking time. These should be fairly accurate. 
			- If user chooses bus stops where source ==  destination, walking time estimate
			  is simply going to be 0
			- If user hasn't chosen bus stops yet, there shouldn't be a walking time 
			  estimate number visible yet.
