    Testing:

        Home.js
            - Upon opening up the application, the layout should be a grey navigation bar on the left with the map on the right
        
        Map.jsx
            - Increasing and decreasing the window should change the size of the map
                - The map should always be about 90% of the window
            - Upon rendering the page, there should be 14 markers on the map 
            - Hovering a mouse over a marker should reveal a text box indicating what bus stop it is
            - Hovering onto another marker will close the provious one and reveal the currently hovered one
            - Pressing the X on the box should be the only way to close the text if no other markers are hovered
