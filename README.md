## **A Web Application for Near-Real Time Tracking of UC Santa Cruz Loop Buses**

### **What is Live Loop?**

The idea of Live Loop is a web application for tracking UC Santa Cruz Loop Buses in near-real Time using GPS coordinates transmitted from each Loop Bus and updates the web application in near-real time. Users are able to see where each Loop Bus is around campus, which can help the user decide if they should wait for a Loop Bus or walk to their destination.

### **Goals of Live Loop**

The goal of this project is to create a working near-real time web application that can update frequently the locations of Loop Buses for the convenience of the user. The project aims to be as simple and user-friendly as possible, but extremely powerful, since the locations of each Loop Buses can change every second. I hope to create a web application that would also be used for future students.

### **Additional Features That Could be Implemented, if Time Permits**

- Near-Real Time tracking for **every** Loop Bus on campus
- An estimated time for a Loop Bus to arrive at a certain stop around campus
- Integration with Santa Cruz Metro Buses (SC Metro already has a similar live map)
- A "Stay or Walk" widget, which dictates if it would be faster for a user to walk to their destination rather than wait for the Loop Bus (during busy times of the day, it may feel like it takes forever for one to show up / bus could be full)
